Full Stack Image Generation App

**Description**

This application allows users to generate images from text descriptions using a Dalle-based model. It combines a frontend user interface for submitting text prompts and a backend server for processing those prompts and generating images.

**Tech Stack**

* Frontend: [Frontend Technology] (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
* Backend: [Backend Technology] (e.g., Python with Flask or Django, Node.js with Express)
* Machine Learning Model: Dalle (or similar image generation model)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-image-generation-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd full-stack-image-generation-app

   # Install frontend dependencies (adjust based on your chosen framework)
   npm install  # or yarn install

   # Install backend dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or npm install  (if using Node.js)
   ```

3. Set up the Dalle model:

   * Download the pre-trained Dalle model weights (if applicable).
   * Configure the backend code to load the model weights from the correct location.
   * Follow the instructions for setting up the Dalle model (these may vary depending on the specific implementation you're using).

**Running the application**

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   #  (For Python backend)
   python backend/app.py

   #  (For Node.js backend)
   node backend/server.js
   ```

2. Run the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   #  (adjust based on your chosen framework)
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your frontend configuration).
